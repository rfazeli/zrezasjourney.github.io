<h3>Pre-Intro</h3>
<p>In this post, I'd like to tell you a bit about why I decided to start a blog and how I went about creating one to hopefully inspire others to start blogging. I will post another piece on a step-by-step guide on building a static blog using Python, Pelican, and Github Pages which are freely available open source tools (although Github is not open source but still free and this is a topic for another discussion).</p>
<p>This post needs a lot of cleaning up but I wanted to publish it anyway to get something out there and gradually improve it. So be prepared for lots of bullet points and possible incosistencies (at least for now). I also need to find better Pelican themes, but I am going to stick with this barebone theme for now and find a better one after writing a few posts. I also need to need to look into available add-ons such as allowing users to comment etc.</p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The idea of creating my own blog started around mid-May 2020. I had written blogposts before on Medium, so I was familiar witht the process and I knew how fun it was. This time I wanted to start my own blog and have my own medium for publishing my writings on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I started looking at blog posts about writing blogs such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">this</a> and <a href="https://danluu.com/about/">this</a>. I also looked at blogs from people who have recently started blogging about topics I am interested in, for example <a href="https://moeinpy.com/">this blog</a> and <a href="https://victorzhou.com/">this one</a>. I also found Hacker News to be a good resource for finding good blog posts.</p>
<p>If you’re like me and you have ideas you want to talk about but you’re not comfortable talking about them because they’re half-baked then blogging gives you an opportunity to spend as much time as you want refining those ideas by writing about them and then you can start talking about them as well. </p>
<p>I used to spend so much time thinking about what I would write about on my blog, I initially thought I could write about the technical topics (mostly focused on data science and computer science) I read about on the internet. While this is certainly how I am going to start my blogging endeavour, it wouldn't be limited to these topics. I have recently started reading about other people’s blogging ventures and I have realized a common theme among them which is that you can write about absolutely anything. So this is what i am going to try and do; to write about absolutely anything over time. It's so liberating. You suddenly feel like you can talk about anything while having the chance to refine your thoughts and avoid impulsive writing in 140 x 2 characters</p>
<h3>The What</h3>
<p>This blog will be focused on writing about my experiences and I hope that it would be useful/inspiring for people out there. Also writing feels good and having a simple blog like this gives me the space, motivation, and commitment to write regularly. So with all the means of starting a blog at my disposal and having the time to actually write about the things I find interesting, I had no other choice than to start this blog.</p>
<p>Another theme of this blog is to share my notes on the papers that I find interesting. These papers are not all necessarily famous or sought-after rather they are papers on topics that I find interesting and hopefully others on the internet would find them interesting.</p>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pandemic started and I had extra time</li>
<li>I wanted to do something that would help me and others learn new stuff.</li>
<li>I wanted a challenge</li>
<li>I wanted to work on something that is mine (in this case I guess I wanted to write on a medium that is mine)</li>
<li>Not just consume (although I enjoy that very much) but create as well.</li>
<li>I read books such as 5am Club etc.</li>
<li>I started brainstorming and the simplest idea was to build a blog and write blog posts. This serves two purposes: I have built something that is mine and I get to write and enjoy the benefits of writing (Include the link to the article that talks about benefits of blogging)</li>
<li>Let’s build a blog and write to teach and learn and fill mine and others knowledge gaps</li>
<li>Learn about launching a website, maintaining it, SEO etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>[To Be Completed Soon ...]</p>
